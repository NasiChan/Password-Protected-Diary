Issues:
Unfortunately, Nitya (3rd group member) was unable to contribute to the project, so we had to proceed without her involvement
As you know, we initially started this project as a team of three. However, due to Nitya’s inability to 
contribute to Phase Two, we had to proceed with the video production as a team of two.
