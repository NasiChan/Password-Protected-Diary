    <h1>About My Diary</h1>
    <p>This project is a simple web diary designed to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features password-protected entries and responsive design.</p>

    <h2>About the Creators</h2>
    <p>The project was built by Nastaran Pedari and Shreya Achari, who are both working on this project to improve their web development skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Nastaran Pedari</strong>: Focused on the behavior and functionality of the diary, ensuring that features such as error handling, entry editing, and secure login work smoothly. Nastaran is responsible for implementing JavaScript logic, such as displaying error messages when credentials are invalid, editing and deleting entries, and ensuring that the system logs out properly without losing data.</p>
    <p><strong>Shreya Achari</strong>: Worked on the structural side of the project, focusing on making the user interface intuitive and visually appealing. Shreya was responsible for the HTML and CSS layout of the diary, including the design and structure of the taskbar, where users can easily navigate to new and existing diary entries. Shreya implemented a clean, user-friendly design with a focus on responsiveness, ensuring that the diary works well across different screen sizes and devices. </p>
